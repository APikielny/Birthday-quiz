Your program will ask the user the following questions, in this order:

Their name.
The name of the month they were born in (e.g. "September").
The year they were born in (e.g. "1962").
The day they were born on (e.g. "11").
If the user's birthday fell on October 31, then respond with:

You were born on Halloween!

If the user's birthday fell on today's date, then respond with:

Happy birthday!

Otherwise respond with a statement like this:

Peter, you are a winter baby of the nineties.
